I performed data profiling on the Zomato dataset to understand its structure, completeness, and quality using various Python packages.

1️⃣ Data Profiling
Used ydata-profiling (formerly pandas-profiling) to generate an automated exploratory data analysis (EDA) report, which included:

1. Summary statistics of numerical and categorical columns
2. Missing values and duplicate records
3. Correlation analysis between features

Used sweetviz to create an interactive report for feature distribution, missing values, and relationships.
